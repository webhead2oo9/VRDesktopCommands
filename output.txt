Traditionally, network bridges for Virtual Desktop are set up by using Internet Connection Sharing on Windows to feed Internet to a router in Access Point mode by the WAN port. The Opal can repeat an Internet connection wirelessly while transmitting its own Wi-Fi signal, as shown in the !opalsetup diagram drawn by @DenTechs.\\n\\nIn this guide, we will set up the GL.iNet Opal to use Repeater Mode, which takes your existing home Wi-Fi connection and repeats it to your PC over Ethernet and your VR headset over its own Wi-Fi signal. This means the Opal router will be able take video data from your PC by Ethernet and send it over Wi-Fi to your VR headset, while also providing an Internet connection to each device. This is both less expensive and more versatile than the D-Link AirBridge solution.

Fortunately, router resets do not revert your passwords or network names.\\n\\nTurning down the TX Power of your Opal Wi-Fi will reduce the range at which your devices can connect to it. While this may seem counterintuitive, it may be a courteous gesture to do so, as your neighbors will have less wireless interference. However, do this at your own risk. It may slow your connection down.\\n\\nDo not use the guest networks on the GL.iNet Opal if you plan to use Virtual Desktop.

If the light stays solid while holding the button, leave the router alone for 5 minutes, as it may be recovering from a crash. Avoid unplugging the router until you have access to the admin panel. This soft reset will restore access to the admin panel and re-enable your Wi-Fi, but you will need to reconnect Repeater Mode.\\n\\n?? CAUTION: Do not hold the reset button for longer than the suggested time, as a 10 second hold WILL cause a FACTORY RESET!\\n\\nWhen this guide was originally written, it was thought that Repeater Mode was too slow to be used for VR and that connecting the GL.iNet router to the home Wi-Fi over 5GHz would cause Virtual Desktop to underperform. This is no longer the case. Testing has proven that Repeater Mode can handle VR just fine and using 5GHz may actually be beneficial in some situations.

Shared bandwidth - it's like too many taps drawing water from the same pipe, slowing down the flow at each tap. \\n2. Interference - it's like dirt in the pipe blocking the flow of water. Other devices can interfere with your Wi-Fi signal. \\n3. Distance and obstacles - it's like the pipe being longer or having turns, slowing down the water.

Now let me start applying the fixes one by one. I'll use the MultiEdit tool to apply all the fixes systematically.\n\nLooking at the specific lines that need to be fixed:\n\n1. Line 8: \"from a number of users\" → \"by a number of users\"\n2. Line 95: Split long sentence and \"setup\" → \"set up\"\n3. Line 605: Break very long sentence into two sentences\n4.

Line 788: \"Follow the below steps\" → \"Follow the steps below\"\n\nLet me check the exact content of these lines first to make sure I understand what needs to be changed.\n\nLine 8: `\"description\": \"The following routers have been reported to work reliably from a number of users.\\nHigh End (AX / WiFi 6) - Asus RT-AX86U ($300 US)\\nDedicated (BE / Wifi 7) - TP-Link BE9300/BE550 ($200-$300 US)\\nDedicated (AXE / WiFi 6E) - Davolink 'Kevin' Minion 6E ($129 US)\\nDedicated (AXE / WiFi 6E) - TP-Link Archer AXE75/AXE5400 ($160-$200 US)\\nDedicated (AX) - PRISMXR Puppis S1 (80$)\\nDedicated (AX / WiFi 6) - GL.iNet Beryl GL-MT3000 ($90 US)\\nLow End (AC / WiFi 5) - GL.iNet Opal GL-SFT1200 ($50 US)\\nLow End (AC / WiFi 5) - TP-Link Archer C6 or A6 ($40 US)\\n\\nTP-Link AX and Huawei routers have been known to have issues we are unable to identify. Higher end TP-Link AX/AXE routers not listed here may work well but as with any router not on this list, should be considered untested.\\nThe TP-Link Archer AXE5400 is not the same thing as the Deco AXE5400. The latter is a mesh router and may not work as expected.\"`\n\nI'll continue the rewrite by addressing the additional context about TP-Link and Huawei routers. Some AX and AXE routers from these manufacturers have potential compatibility issues. While higher-end models might function, they should be treated as unverified. Specifically, the TP-Link Archer AXE5400 differs from the Deco AXE5400 mesh router, which could have unexpected performance.\n\nThe TP-Link Archer AXE75/AXE5400 provides a reliable Wifi 6e router solution specifically designed for wireless VR streaming. Its dedicated performance makes it a solid choice for users seeking stable wireless connectivity for VR applications.\n\nThe RT-AX86U emerges as an excellent home networking solution with robust wireless streaming capabilities. Its support for DFS channels helps mitigate interference in densely populated wireless environments, ensuring more consistent signal quality.\n\nConfiguring the extender mode can significantly improve network performance, especially when experiencing slower internet connections or needing broader device network visibility.\n\nFor graphics drivers, careful selection is crucial. Nvidia RTX 30/40 series and AMD RX/5000/6000/7000/9000 series have specific recommended driver versions to prevent potential compatibility and performance issues.\n\nRouter troubleshooting often involves simple steps like rebooting, but modern high-bandwidth applications now require Gigabit Ethernet connections with AC or AX routers to ensure stable performance.\n\nWhen reinstalling Windows, users should download the appropriate ISO from Microsoft's official website, carefully following on-screen instructions while prioritizing data backup to prevent potential information loss during the process.\n\nFor both Windows 10 and 11, the key steps involve obtaining the correct installation media, running the ISO, and selecting options that preserve existing files and applications, with special attention to system compatibility and personal data
