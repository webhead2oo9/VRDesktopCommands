Traditionally, network bridges for Virtual Desktop are set up by using Internet Connection Sharing on Windows to feed Internet to a router in Access Point mode by the WAN port. The Opal can repeat an Internet connection wirelessly while transmitting its own Wi-Fi signal, as shown in the !opalsetup diagram drawn by @DenTechs.\n\nIn this guide, we will set up the GL.iNet Opal to use Repeater Mode, which takes your existing home Wi-Fi connection and repeats it to your PC over Ethernet and your VR headset over its own Wi-Fi signal. This means the Opal router will be able take video data from your PC by Ethernet and send it over Wi-Fi to your VR headset, while also providing an Internet connection to each device. This is both less expensive and more versatile than the D-Link AirBridge solution. The setup process is very easy and should take no longer than 20 minutes to complete.",

All GL.iNet Opal routers have the same default Wi-Fi passwords, which is why Step 4e is required. Fortunately, router resets do not revert your passwords or network names.\n\nTurning down the TX Power of your Opal Wi-Fi will reduce the range at which your devices can connect to it. While this may seem counterintuitive, it may be a courteous gesture to do so, as your neighbors will have less wireless interference. However, do this at your own risk. It may slow your connection down.\n\nDo not use the guest networks on the GL.iNet Opal if you plan to use Virtual Desktop. Having guest networks enabled is unnecessary and can lead to problems connecting or using VR. This does not apply to the Opal exclusively; guest networks should be avoided generally for Virtual Desktop."

The light will slowly blink blue 3 times. Let go as soon as it starts to blink faster. If the light stays solid while holding the button, leave the router alone for 5 minutes, as it may be recovering from a crash. Avoid unplugging the router until you have access to the admin panel. This soft reset will restore access to the admin panel and re-enable your Wi-Fi, but you will need to reconnect Repeater Mode.\n\n?? CAUTION: Do not hold the reset button for longer than the suggested time, as a 10 second hold WILL cause a FACTORY RESET!\n\nWhen this guide was originally written, it was thought that Repeater Mode was too slow to be used for VR and that connecting the GL.iNet router to the home Wi-Fi over 5GHz would cause Virtual Desktop to underperform. This is no longer the case. Testing has proven that Repeater Mode can handle VR just fine and using 5GHz may actually be beneficial in some situations. Depending on your situation, it may even give your PC full speed Internet.\n\nChoosing Extender Mode may be helpful if you need to use local connections with other devices."

Ive seen this happen frequently after making changes to my router. If it fails to connect after two or three attempts, restart your PC and headset.

However, the actual flow can be slower due to several reasons: \n1. Shared bandwidth - it's like too many taps drawing water from the same pipe, slowing down the flow at each tap. \n2. Interference - it's like dirt in the pipe blocking the flow of water. Other devices can interfere with your Wi-Fi signal. \n3. Distance and obstacles - it's like the pipe being longer or having turns, slowing down the water. Being further from the router or having walls in between can slow down your Wi-Fi. \nSo, a big pipe (high link speed) doesn't always mean fast water flow (high data speed)."

HOWEVER, wifi 6E uses the 6Ghz band which is primarily not used by other devices and will not suffer from as much interference and congestion as Wifi 6 which should mean it performs better.\nIn the first image below I had two machines, both using Wifi 6 (5Ghz) and I was transferring a file between them. In the second image the exact same machines were connected to the same router with Wifi 6E (6Ghz). As you can see, the Wifi 6E connection was much more stable and nearly twice as fast because of a lack of interference!\nNote: For some the 6Ghz band does not work as well over longer distances.

For instance, if your PC can only render **45fps**, the headset will fill in the gaps, keeping a smooth **90fps** experience.\n\nSSW can introduce graphical **artifacts** that may appear as warping or straight lines bending, so if possible it's **preferable for your pc to render the full fps.** However SSW is **beneficial on lower end systems**, or when you want to **push higher graphical settings** than your PC is capable of normally.\n\nThis is **different** to PC technologies like DLSS 3 which ***interpolate*** frames as opposed to ***extrapolating*** frames.
